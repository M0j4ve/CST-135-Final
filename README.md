This Python-based application provides a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing a database of planets. 
The program features a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input, view, and modify data related to various planets. 
Changes made in the window are reflected in an SQL database, allowing for dynamic data management.

Key Features:

    Create: Add new planets to the database.
    Read: View details of planets stored in the database.
    Update: Edit existing planet information.
    Delete: Remove planets from the database.
    Clear: Reset all text fields in the GUI, allowing users to quickly start entering a new planet's data without manually clearing the fields.

The data is stored in an SQL database, which can be easily exported and imported as needed.

Technologies Used:

    Python 3.x
    SQLite3 (for the database)
    Tkinter (for the GUI)
